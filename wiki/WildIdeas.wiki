In a corporate setting you could have an application server acting as a "logic repository". A frontend application like a webserver could query it to get an instance of a (direct) model. In addition this repository would supply the necessary class files (for example by referring to a particular version in a maven repository). This model could know how to call back to the app server for additional data.
