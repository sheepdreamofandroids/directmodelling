#summary Bad artists copy, great artists steal

= Who had this idea first? =

Obviously directmodelling is not a new idea but has been researched before. Here I want to list some resources where some of these ideas have been discussed:

 * http://www.nakedobjects.org/ A complete client/server application missing just your specific business logic. Go here for a enterprise ready implementation of many ideas discussed on this project.
 * http://xstm.net/ An amazing idea. Unfortunately the project seems inactive.
 * http://joda.sourceforge.net/beans.html Another implementation of property objects. Inactive.
