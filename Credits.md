# Who had this idea first? #

Directmodelling is not an entirely new idea but has been researched before. Here are some resources where similar ideas have been discussed:

  * http://www.nakedobjects.org/ A complete client/server application missing just your specific business logic. Go here for a enterprise ready implementation of many ideas discussed on this project.
  * http://xstm.net/ An amazing idea. Unfortunately the project seems inactive.
  * http://joda.sourceforge.net/beans.html Another implementation of property objects. Inactive.
