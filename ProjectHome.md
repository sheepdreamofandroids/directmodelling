Here I want to explore the possibilities of modelling behaviour using property objects. The goals are:
  * code that reflects the [mental model](https://code.google.com/p/directmodelling/wiki/WhatIsDM) of the user
  * an absolute separation between presentation logic and presentation technology
  * easy testing of UI code
  * a functional (reactive) coding style for models
  * a very powerful binding interface

Fringe benefits:
  * easy STM and replication.
  * reuse of presentation logic on multiple platforms
